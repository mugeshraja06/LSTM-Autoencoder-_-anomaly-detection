# LSTM Autoencoder _ anomaly detection _Time Series
Anomaly detection on Time Series data by using LSTM Autoencoder

Objective: We have the chosen GE motor dataset from Yahoo finance which available from 2000 to 2020. Our ultimate goal is to build the model to detect anomaly pattern in dataset.       

Outcome: We were able to build the models to detect the anomaly pattern in dataset.
